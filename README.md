## <a id="project-outline"></a>Project Outline

Through comprehensive data analysis, genre comparisons, historical insights, and statistical correlations, this project seeks to unravel the intricate web of factors contributing to a movie's success. The findings will provide valuable insights for industry professionals, filmmakers, and enthusiasts alike, shedding light on the nuanced elements crucial for achieving success in the ever-evolving landscape of Movies.

Questions for which we will be testing our hypotheses for many factors in the Movie industry that may contribute to its success:

* Question 1: How have movie ratings evolved over the years, and are there discernible trends within different genres or directors?

* Question 2: Which movie genres reign supreme in popularity, and is there a correlation between a movie's genre and its commercial success?

* Question 3: Do certain actors or directors wield a significant influence on a movie's success or ratings?

* Question 4: How does the duration of a movie impact audience reception and ratings? Are longer or shorter movies more favorably received?
  
* Question 5: Is there a relationship between a movie's budget, box office performance, ratings, and how timing influences these dynamics?


## <a id="data-sources"></a>Data Sources

We have used two Sources for our Datasets:
* https://www.omdbapi.com/
* https://github.com/danielgrijalva/movie-stats

The raw data extracted from the sources were cleaned and organised in the following jupiter notebook files:
* OMDBmoviedata.ipynb
* movie_data.ipynb

The cleaned datasets that were used to create our statistical analysis and visualisations:
* OMDBmoviedata.csv
* movies_cleaned.csv

(All resources used; raw data, cleaned data and files used to clean our databases are included in the Resources folder of the Repository:
